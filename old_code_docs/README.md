# Cascade Model Rainfall Disaggregation
Disaggregate rainfall time series using a multiplicative discrete random cascade model.
Parameters of the model are identified using the maximum likelihood method.
The model is evaluated using the fitted parameters and rainfall is simulated.
The output of one level is the input to the second level.
The script CascadeModelClass.py finds the model parameters and runs the simulations.
In case the model is used please be kind to reference it.
